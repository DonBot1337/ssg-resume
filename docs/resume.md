### Programming Languages

**Disclaimer:** To save time, I won't list every language I've briefly encountered for a single project during my time at university or in private projects. Although I've used many other languages for varying durations, and have plans to explore more in the future, the following exclusively highlights my areas of expertise.

| Language   | Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python     | Python is my primary programming language and I deeply enjoy working with it. Some of my favorite libraries include _Pandas_ for data manipulation, _NumPy_ for numerical computing, _Flask_ for web development, _Beautiful Soup_ and _Requests_ for web scraping and HTTP requests, _Fire_ for command-line interfaces, _Matplotlib_ for data visualization, _Coloredlogs_ and _Colorama_ for adding color to terminal output, _JmesPath_ for JSON manipulation, and _TQDM_ for progress bars in CLI applications. |
| JavaScript | I have advanced proficiency in JavaScript, mostly in "Vanilla JS" and _VueJS_. I also know a bit of _JQuery_, but I am a big proponent of [You might not need jQuery](https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) so I rarely use it these days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Tools / Misc

| Tool       | Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| GitLab     | I gained extensive experience in GitLab, particularly in designing and implementing efficient CI pipelines with GitLab CI. Additionally, I oversaw repository and group administration for our team over a five-year period, starting with me migrating their former code over from _SVN_ to _Git_.                                                                                                               |
| Pre-Commit | I strongly support the _pre-commit_ tool for its effectiveness in catching issues early in the development cycle, leading to improved codebase hygiene and reduced debugging time. I believe it is a significant improvement for collaboration on code, as it removes discussions about code style from the review process (almost) entirely, allowing reviewers to focus solely on functional aspects and logic. |
