I enjoy exploring the intricate details of these subjects and exchanging my knowledge with others. I regularly fix computer problems (both software and hardware) for friends and family, finding great satisfaction in troubleshooting and resolving technical issues. Additionally, one of my most fulfilling activities is teaching complex topics to individuals who initially find them daunting and witnessing their moments of understanding and empowerment. As a result, I often took on tutoring jobs for subjects such as Mathematics and Physics. In the end, it proved to be a win-win situation. Of course I am also interested in a lot of \"nerdstuff\" and know a thing or two about Warhammer 40k lore or Magic the Gathering 's seemingly infinite number of different cards. Playing Games on PC and sometimes on gaming consoles stopped using my primary hobby a long time ago, but every now and then the old squad reassembles and we have fun like if we were children once again. Core Values and Personal Traits I am an enthusiastic and fast learner, particularly when it comes to subjects that capture my interest, regardless of their complexity. While I may not always initiate conversations, I genuinely appreciate differing opinions and approaches. I find great value in engaging with people, particularly those who are experts in areas I'm eager to learn more about. I enjoy helping people. I am always friendly and professional. I prefer rational, well informed approaches over spontaneous ones.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-me","text":"","title":"About Me"},{"location":"about/#interests","text":"I have a deep passion for History, Geo-Politics, and Astro-Physics.

Language Experience Python Python is my primary programming language and I deeply enjoy working with it. Some of my favorite libraries include Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computing, Flask for web development, Beautiful Soup and Requests for web scraping and HTTP requests, Fire for command-line interfaces, Matplotlib for data visualization, Coloredlogs and Colorama for adding color to terminal output, JmesPath for JSON manipulation, and TQDM for progress bars in CLI applications.

Tools / Misc Tool Experience GitLab I gained extensive experience in GitLab, particularly in designing and implementing efficient CI pipelines with GitLab CI. Additionally, I oversaw repository and group administration for our team over a five-year period, starting with me migrating their former code over from SVN to Git . Pre-Commit I strongly support the pre-commit tool for its effectiveness in catching issues early in the development cycle, leading to improved codebase hygiene and reduced debugging time. I believe it is a significant improvement for collaboration on code, as it removes discussions about code style from the review process (almost) entirely, allowing reviewers to focus solely on functional aspects and logic.","title":"Resume"},{"location":"resume/#resume","text":"","title":"Resume"},{"location":"resume/#professional-experience","text":"","title":"Professional Experience"},{"location":"resume/#software-developer","text":"CONTACT Software GmbH , Bremen (June 2019 - Today) Developing Python applications that were included in our core product Automating frequent tasks with scripts (Python, Bash, Powershell, JavaScript) Several smaller sized JavaScript implementations for FrontEnd functionalities GitLab administration / GitLab CI Maintaining multiple K8s services Onboarding and technical support for all of my teammates","title":"Software Developer"},{"location":"resume/#junior-software-developer-working-student","text":"CONTACT Software GmbH , Bremen (October 2018 \u2192 June 2019) Migration of all team owned code from SVN to Git repos (hosted with GitLab) Extraction of an application from the central monolithic software and maintaining that appliction for the next years","title":"Junior Software Developer - Working Student"},{"location":"resume/#education","text":"Degree Bachelor of Science: Digital Media Universit\u00e4t Bremen, Bremen, Germany Winter 2013 \u2192 Spring 2020","title":"Education"},{"location":"resume/#skills","text":"","title":"Skills"},{"location":"resume/#programming-languages","text":"Disclaimer: To save time, I won't list every language I've briefly encountered for a single project during my time at university or in private projects.
