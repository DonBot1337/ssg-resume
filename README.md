# Repo for my Resume Website

Welcome to the repository for my resume site.

Feel free to look around in these sources.
However, if you want to see the deployed website, please go to:

## Additional Information

This site has been built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
It has been deployed via [`mkdocs gh-deploy`](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/#project-pages).

In the future I want to change this so I can avoid having a branch that contains built static files.
In GitLab CI this would have been easy for me but I am not yet familiar with GitHub actions.
